My understanding as of now: 

Data Engineering - getting, transforming and delivering data consumers
Data Consumers - business decision makers, data scientists, front line users
Data Engineers - people who do the engineering; build pipeline; transform the data like cleaning/formatting
Data Pipeline - how the data gets from source, transformed, and made available to users

Cloud Data Engineering: 
Previously data engineering was done in on-prem data centers, maybe via Hadoop, which is open source software that distributed storage and processsing
jobs in hardware/datacenters. 
Now in the cloud data storage and processing can be done more efficiently with less resources dedicated to the storage and management of the data. 

Cloud Stuff: 
Containers - software package that contain what you need to run an app.
Microservices - apps built in a modular fashion that breaks up processes into microservices?
CI/CD - so far all I have on this is that it stands for continuous integration/continuous delivery

So, what was previously an IT heavy task is now dispersed with data engineering doing most of the engineering work but also IT managing security/compliance/governance.
